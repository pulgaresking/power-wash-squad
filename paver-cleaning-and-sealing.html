            <h3>What is Paver Cleaning and Sealing?</h3>
            <p>
              Patio pavers are chosen as an exterior hardscape feature for
              homeowners and business operators for several reasons. For one,
              they allow you to customize the look of your patio, walkways, and
              other entertainment areas to suit your personal preferences.
              Pavers are the only way to get an appearance that is truly unique
              from every other house else on the block. The problem is, these
              features also tend to wear down and get dirty more quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paver cleaning and sealing in Power Wash Squad is the only way to
              remove all the mud, moss, algae, dirt, grime, and other debris
              that are taking over your pathways. Power Wash Squad of
              Westchester has developed efficient, affordable, and reliable
              methods for safely and gently blasting away the problem while also
              providing a quality seal to prevent the issue from returning
              prematurely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Salt, oil, gas, dirt, and other contaminants can quickly decrease
              the value and appeal of your property. Instead of trying to scrub
              the mess away on your own, trust that our highly-trained experts
              will get it done right and at a reasonable price. Estimates are
              always FREE, so call now for yours.
