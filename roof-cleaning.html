            <h3>Top Rated Power Wash Squad Roof Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
              Your home needs the highest-rated roof cleaning in Westchester. A
              professional roof wash will remove built-up debris that can damage
              roofing tiles and shingles, while also restoring the color of a
              roof, enhancing your property’s overall curb appeal.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of Soft Wash Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
              Regular, professional roof cleaning does more than make your
              home’s roof look good; roof soft wash pressure washing removes
              damaging debris, including twigs, leaves, seeds, bird droppings,
              residue from acid rain, as well as dirt and algae that get lodged
              between roofing tiles. A professional roof shingle cleaner can
              remove all that debris, keeping tiles and shingles secure and
              intact.

            <h3>Expert Roof Pressure Washing – The Soft Wash Way</h3>
            <p>
              Roof <a href="service-areas.html">pressure washing</a> can dislodge twigs, seeds,
              leaves, and other debris from under shingles and tiles, but a
              high-pressure roof power washing can also damage those shingles,
              even blowing them right off the roof! A soft wash roof cleaning
              uses high-quality detergents and surfactants to dissolve dirt and
              debris, and less water pressure to rinse away that waste, so that
              roofing shingles don’t get dislodged or otherwise damaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              A soft wash roof cleaning is also best for older roofs, or those
              with damaged or brittle tiles and shingles. A high-pressure wash,
              or scraping a roof with a stiff-bristled brush, can damage those
              weakened tiles, causing them to become thin and crumbly. Thin,
              worn, or crumbly roofing tiles increases the risk of water leaks
              into the home, and also means losing more heat and air
              conditioning through the roof, causing your utility bills to
              spike!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="first-right">
            <h3>Why a Soft Wash is Best for Cleaning Moss Off Roof</h3>
            <p>
              Moss, algae, mold, and mildew can grow between roofing tiles,
              causing those shingles to become loose, so they’re more likely to
              blow away in a storm. A high-pressure roof cleaning may not
              effectively remove this debris, as pressurized water only blows
              away their vegetation, without killing their spores!
            </p>
            <p>
              Soft wash roof cleaning chemicals are designed to remove
              biological materials, including the spores of moss, algae, and
              other such contaminants. Having a soft wash roof cleaning for an
              Westchester home means less risk of that moss, algae, mold,
              mildew, and other irritants growing back over the years.

            <h3>Your Roof Cleaning Cost Is An Investment In Your Home</h3>
            <p>
              Regular roof cleaning of a Michigan home is an investment in your
              property. A thorough and professional roof wash will protect
              shingles from damage caused by acid rain residue, twigs that
              scrape the surface of those tiles, and moss that loosens tiles
              from their connectors. You then need to replace those shingles far
              less often when you invest in a regular roof soft wash for your
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Roof cleaning of a Michigan home also removes contaminants that
              hold moisture next to the roof paper, causing it to get soft and
              crumbly. When roofing paper gets soft, it’s more prone to
              suffering rips or tears, increasing the risk of water leaks and
              resultant mold growth in the home. A roof soft wash then protects
              your home’s roof from this damage.

            <h3>Roof Pressure Washing Is Not a DIY Job!</h3>
            <p>
              If your home needs roof cleaning, why not just rent a pressure
              washer and tackle this job yourself? The short answer is that a
              roof wash is not a DIY job! One important reason for this is that
              misusing a pressure washer can mean blowing tiles and shingles
              right off your home’s roof or causing old and brittle tiles to
              crumble and break away.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can also be challenging to decide on the right roof cleaning
              chemicals to use for a home’s roof, as some cleansers are meant
              for just a lightweight cleaning, whereas other, stronger chemicals
              are needed to kill mold, algae, mildew, and moss. However, these
              stronger chemicals can be hazardous and harmful to your skin,
              eyes, and nasal passages, and can also harm your precious
              flowerbeds and landscaping features. To protect your property and
              even your health, leave this work to a professional roof cleaning
              company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trained technicians from a roof cleaning company will also know
              how to stay safe on ladders or on the roof itself. Properly
              trained technicians will also know when a soft wash roof cleaning
              is recommended, to protect old and brittle tiles, or to ensure
              that mold, moss, algae, and other biological contaminants are
              thoroughly cleaned and washed away from your home’s roof!

            <p>
              If your home needs a thorough roof cleaning, it’s also time to
              clean the home’s gutters, exterior walls, sidewalks and driveway,
              and windows. Built-up dust, dirt, mud, oil stains, and residue
              from salt used to clean away snow during Michigan winters can
              cause wood to get soft and cracked, concrete to spall and chip,
              and brick to get soft and crumbly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rainwater can also spill over the sides of clogged gutters,
              causing water damage to a home’s walls and foundation. Cleaning
              clogged gutters is probably no homeowner’s idea of a fun Sunday
              afternoon, but the trained technicians at Power Wash Squad can
              make quick work of cleaning your home’s gutters while also giving
              your home’s roof a soft wash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neglecting to wash the exterior of your home’s windows can be just
              as damaging, as built-up dirt and debris can etch window glass,
              creating small nicks and cuts in those windows. This buildup
              allows even more dirt and debris to settle onto the surface of
              window glass, making windows look cloudy and dull. To avoid these
              risks and ensure your home is always in good repair, call us when
              you need concrete, deck, window, and roof soft wash.

              &nbsp;Power Wash Squad of Westchester City did a FANTASTIC job.
              Our home hadn't been properly power washed since we moved in and
              it seriously looks like a different house. The walkway looks brand
              new as well.
